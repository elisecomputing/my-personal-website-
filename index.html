    <section id="about">
        <h2>All About Me</h2>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>I plan to start college in Spring 2025 at Wake Tech Community College, where I'll be studying Web Development and Graphic Design. From there, I hope to continue my education at a university.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to become a full-stack developer & graphic designer, combining my love for coding with creativity.</p>
        <p>I've been learning web development through Codecademy, freeCodeCamp,Udemy,and Great Learning. So far, I've earned multiple certificates and I'm excited to continue growing my skills!</p>
        <p>I'm excited to start learning JavaScript and data structures through freeCodeCamp. Diving deeper into these topics will help me build more interactive and efficient web applications.</p>

        <h4>What I Like To Do</h4>
        <p>When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me reading a good book, watching my favorite TV shows, listening to music, or just spending time with my pets. I love getting lost in new worlds, whether it's through a story or a great series.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite TV shows are Gilmore Girls, The Vampire Diaries, La Brea, Mrs. Maisel, and The Wilds.</p>
        <p>Music is also a big part of my life. I enjoy listening to artists like Blackbear, ROSIE, Jessie Murph, Gracie Abrams, Tink, FINNEAS, Lewis Capaldi, FLETCHER, and Ashley Kutcher.</p>

        <h5>My Pets</h5>
        <p> I have a small but lively pet family!</p>
        <p>My rescue beagle, Ralph, is a sleepy guy.</p>
        <p>My three cats—Hocus Pocus, Binx, and Gargoyle—each have their own unique personalities and love to play. And then there's Truffles, my guinea pig, who always squeaks.</p>
